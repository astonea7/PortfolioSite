# PortfolioSite

This is the preview for my portfolio website. My idea is to have a main page with my picture on it along with a brief description of me and my goals. Then under that, I plan to have 3 different icons that represent 3 areas that I feel passionate about and want to pursue in my future career. Each icon will be a clickable link that will lead you to another page of similar layout/format. Right now, I have the top navigagtion bar, however; it is covering some of the information behind it and I need to fix that. I also have the letter 'a' icon in the top and it allows you to scroll back up to the top of the page when needed. 
* I had to delete all the old files I had because they weren't in the proper folders and my site would have been unusable that way. Thanks to the help of a classmate, I learned how to upload entire folders and everything in them so that everything stays together in the intended way! So I am now reuploading all of this to make it more cohesive (12/10/23) *
